    <p>Triangles can be grouped according to their sides that are equal
    <ul>
        <li>If all the three sides of a triangle have 
            equal length, it is an equilateral triangle </li>

        <li>If a triangle has two sides with same length, then
            it is an <mark>isosceles triangle</mark>
        </li>

        <li>If all the three sides of a triangle have 
            different lengths then we have a scalene triangle</li>
